Amber's conglomerate corporation just acquired some new companies.
Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. 
Order your output by ascending company_code.
Note:
The tables may contain duplicate records.
The company_code is string, so the sorting should not be numeric. For example, if the company_codes are C_1, C_2, and C_10, then the ascending company_codes will be C_1, C_10, and C_2.

SELECT Employee.company_code, 
    Company.founder, 
    count(Distinct Employee.lead_manager_code) as Lead_Manager, 
    count(Distinct Employee.senior_manager_code) as Senior_Manager, 
    count(Distinct Employee.manager_code) as Manager, 
    count(Distinct Employee.employee_code) as Employees
from Employee
    inner join Company on Employee.company_code = Company.company_code
    group by Employee.company_code, Company.founder
